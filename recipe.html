<h1>Pork <b>Adobo</b></h1>
<h2><i>This is a recipe post for Filipino Pork <b>Adobo</b>. It is a dish composed of pork slices cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic. There are version wherein onions are also added. <b>Adobo</b> is a popular dish in the Philippines, along with Sinigang.
<b>Adobo</b>, in general, can be cooked using different kinds of protein. Chicken is the commonly used ingredient. Have you tried cooking Filipino Chicken <b>Adobo</b> yet? Our tried and tested recipe should be able to help you.</i></h2>
<h3>Filipino Pork <b>Adobo</b> vs. Mexican <b>Adobo</b></h3>
<p>The word <b>Adobo</b> was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. It means to marinate. This can be in the form of a liquid marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.
This version of Filipino <b>Adobo</b> suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. By preference, vinegar can also be added as a marinade ingredient.
Mexican <b>adobo</b>, on the other hand, makes use of chillies, garlic, cinnamon, and oregano as marinade.
Both dishes look and taste different. It will be unfair to compare which among the two dishes are best because each of us has our own preference when it comes to flavor.</p>
<h3><font color="red">Pork and Chicken <b>Adobo</b></font></h3>
<p>Almost every region in the Philippines have their own pork <b>adobo</b> version. Sometimes, there can be more than one version in a location.</p>
<p>This is one of the favorite when it comes to family picnics. This is a dish wherein pork and chicken slices are combined and cooked inadobo style. It can be done the same way as this recipe, with or without onions. This is our clans signature summer dish in the Philippines. I remember my tito’s and tita’s prepare a large portion every summer outing. We would go to Pansol in Laguna to rent a swimming pool for the clan and they would bring with them two large cauldrons (kaldero). One has the <b>adobo</b> in it, while the other is for the rice.</p>
<h3><font color="red">Pork <b>Adobo</b> with Potato</font></h3>
<p>This is another version that I tried. This is a saucier pork adobo version with cubes of potatoes in it. I’m not sure where this dish originated. It might have been initially created as a filler to feed more people. Nevertheless, I liked the taste. I think that it can be improved by pan-frying the potato first. Most of the flavors gets absorbed by the potato. It can be a carbohydrate overload when you eat the potato with rice. This is a good dish to have when before going to the gym or before starting a marathon.
<h3><font color="red">Pork <b>Adobo</b> with Eggs</font></h3>
<p>This is my favorite. There are two ways to make it. Both ways require boiling the eggs beforehand. The first version is cooked by adding boiled eggs once the pork gets tender. The eggs absorb the soy sauce, thus becomes darker in color. Be cautious about the time when cooking this way. We don’t want to overcook the eggs.</p>
<p>How can we tell if an egg is overcooked? It is simple. Egg yolk contain iron. When eggs are cooked longer than the usual, the iron turns greenish. This color formation happens between the yolk and egg white. We often refer to this as rings. Slice the boiled egg in half and try to examine the color of the outer yolk. When you see a dark ring around it, that means the egg is overcooked.</p>
<p>The other version of the <b>adobo</b> with egg is easier and does not put the eggs at risk of overcooking (unless it was overcooked during the boiling process). Simply add boiled eggs on the serving plate before serving. The eggs also retains its white color.</p>
<h3><font color="red"><b>Adobo</b> with Tofu</font></h3>
<p>This is a protein-rich <b>adobo</b> version. It is perfect for people who like their <b>adobo</b> mild in flavor. This version requires fried tofu. Always use extra firm tofu when making this. You can purchase raw tofu and fry it, or you can get packaged fried tofu from the supermarket.The tofu absorbs most of the sauce in the process which tones down the flavor a bit. This is a good dish to prepare when you are into body building or into a protein-rich diet. Make sure to use lean cuts of pork though.</p>
<p>A favorite among our group of friends who like to drink beer is Spicy Pork <b>Adobo</b>. This is the perfect pulutan as far as I am concerned. The spicier it gets, the better it becomes. I tried making this dish using the former spiciest chili pepper in the world, Bhut Jolokia (It lost its crown to the Carolina Reaper, which is way spicier). The result was a very delicious and extremely spicy adobo. The spice lingers in the mouth for a while. Be forewarned.</p>
<h3><font color="red">Adobong Baboy sa Gata</font></h3>
<p>Classic! This is notorious for making people on limited-rice-diet crave for more rice. It is very rich, tasty, and delicious. Add a few pieces of Thai chili pepper, and you will not get enough of it.</p>
