<p>There are many ways to cook fried chicken. This version is quick and simple. The overall flavor caters to the Filipino palette. It has a hint of “toyomansi”, and can be flavorful despite the short marinating time. As far as the texture is concerned, it is crispy on the outside, while tender and juicy inside.</p>
