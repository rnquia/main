<p>Pork Sinigang or Sinigang na Baboy is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This particular soup dish uses pork as the main ingredient though beef, shrimp, fish, and even chicken (this is known as sinampalukang manok) can be used. Bony parts of the pig known as “buto-buto” are usually preferred for this dish. These parts can be either of the following: pork neck bone, chopped spare ribs, chopped baby back ribs, and pork belly. Sometimes pork kasim and pigue (pork ham) are also used.</p>
