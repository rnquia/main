<img src="https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/adobo-fried-rice-1-500x485.jpg">
<p>Adobo is a classic Filipino dish –– one that you can enjoy any time of day. While there are many different kinds of adobo (fish, squid ––even kangkong!), this rice version makes use of leftover juicy pork. Pork adobo is one of the most common, and also most beloved versions of adobo in our country. After all, it’s hard not to love the pair of tender meat pieces in the saucy toyo and vinegar. </p>
