<font face="Courier" size="12"><p>Once, there lived a sweet tempered girl whose name was <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font>. Unfortunately, 
her <font color="#37115a"><b>mother</b></font> died young, and her <font color="#37115a"><b>father</b></font> married again. His <font color="#37115a"><b>second wife</b></font> 
had a sharp temper and her <font color="#37115a"><b>two daughters</b></font> were just like her. In a word - horrid.</p>

<p>The <font color="#37115a"><b>horrid sisters</b></font> loved to boss <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font>. The first said:</p>

<p>“<font color="#37115a"><b>Cinders</b></font>! It’s your job to clean the fireplace. That’s why you’re called <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinders</b></font>! Get it?”</p>

<p>And before she had finished sweeping the grate, the <font color="#37115a"><b>second sister</b></font> said,</p>

<p>“<font color="#37115a"><b>Cinders</b></font>! Don’t dawdle. Light up the fire and make me a hot bath with sweet smelling candles!”</p>

<p>And as she was heating the bath, the <font color="#37115a"><b>horrid mother</b></font> said, “<font color="#37115a"><b>Cinders</b></font>! Why haven’t you 
been to the market yet?”</p>

<p>All day long, <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> swept, and scrubbed, and fetched and carried.</p>

<p>In winter, the <font color="#37115a"><b>young ladies</b></font> were invited to the <font color="#26580f"><u>Royal Ball</u></font>. For a whole month they tried on taffeta ball gowns, 
frilly petticoats, and strappy shoes. It was <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font>, of course, who helped them in and out of their rich costumes, 
and who pressed and folded everything. Her own clothes were practically rags.</p>

<p>The big night came and poor <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> was left at home, sitting alone <font color="#26580f"><u>by the fireplace</u></font>.
<p>A <font color="#37115a"><b>mouse</b></font> came up to her and said, “Dear, dear, don’t fret. A <font color="#37115a"><b>good fairy</b></font> is 
outside, and she says that you shall go to the ball.”</p>

<p><font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> ran out to the <font color="#26580f"><u>courtyard</u></font> where the <font color="#37115a"><b>good fairy</b></font> told the <font color="#37115a"><b>young girl</b></font>:</p>

<p>“Be sure to leave the ball before the clock strikes midnight, or you will be more embarrassed than you ever have been in your life!”</p>

<p>A golden coach took her to the <font color="#26580f"><u>palace</u></font>, and on the way she changed into a beautiful gown. When she entered the <font color="#26580f"><u>ballroom</u></font>, all eyes 
were upon her, including those of her sisters who did not recognise her. The <font color="#37115a"><b>prince</b></font> asked the new arrival to dance, not once, but 
again and again. Before the evening was out, he had fallen in love with the mysterious young beauty. He was about to ask for her hand 
in marriage when the clock began to strike twelve.</p>

<p>“Oh! You must excuse me!” exclaimed<font color="#37115a"><b> Cinderella</b></font> and she ran for the door.<font color="#b22222"><sup> As she dashed down the steps, one of her dancing 
slippers fell from her foot and she had to hop to the coach.</sup></font></p>

<p>In the morning, <font color="#0a1172"><sub>the <font color="#37115a"><b>Prince</b></font> found the lost slipper and ordered his servants to take it up and down the land until they discovered 
the foot that exactly fitted it.</sub></font></p>

<p>When the <font color="#37115a"><b>Prince’s servants</b></font> came to the house where <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> lived, her 
<font color="#37115a"><b>horrid sisters</b></font> were eager to try on the slipper.</p>

<p>“It fits me perfectly,” said the first, but she could not shove her heal inside.</p>

<p>“You can call me, ‘Your Royal Highness’ because my foot fits better,” said the second. But it was clear that her 
foot was even less able to slip into the slipper.</p>

<p>The <font color="#37115a"><b>royal servant</b></font> looked up and saw <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> sitting <font color="#26580f"><u>by the fireplace</u></font> that she had been cleaning. There was a 
bit of soot on her nose, and it made her face all the more charming. He said:</p>

<p>“Would you care to try on the shoe, miss?”</p>

<p>“Why bother with her? She’s just the maid,” said the <font color="#37115a"><b>horrid sisters’ mother</b></font>.</p>

<p>“I would like to try, thank you,” said <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font>. Her foot slipped in perfectly.</p>

<p>“Who would have thought it? Our quest is complete,” declared the <font color="#37115a"><b>royal servant</b></font>.</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed the <font color="#37115a"><b>mother</b></font>. “You’ve got to be kidding!”</p>

<p>“You idiot, you’ve got the wrong girl,” protested the <font color="#37115a"><b>horrid sisters</b></font></p>

<p>But the <font color="#37115a"><b>servant</b></font> was already calling for the coachman to take <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> to the palace, 
dressed in her rags, exactly as she was, and wearing her normal shoe on one foot, and her dancing slipper on the other.</p>

<p>As <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> left the <font color="#26580f"><u>house</u></font>, the <font color="#37115a"><b>mother of the horrid girls</b></font> cried out, 
“Good riddance! We’ve had enough of your cheek!”</p>

<p>But <font color="#37115a"><b>Cinderella</b></font> knew that she had found true love, and the very next day, she and the <font color="#37115a"><b>prince</b></font> 
were wed, and the bells rang out all over the land.</p>

<p>Moral of the Story : <font color="#eedc9a"><em>The moral of the story is displaying bravery and self-confidence in the face of danger, as well as how good people are rewarded for their goodness.</em></font></font>
